This is a weather app i have created to practice SwiftUI on a weekend. 
Some things i had practiced with this project is
1. Repository Pattern for Data Persistance.
2. Using Public Restful APIs and integrating them in our project.
3. Building Complex Interfaces in SwiftUI
4. Making Generic Networking Layer to cover all the test cases with Error Handling.
5. Unit Tests to cover more than 80% of the code.

Development of this Project was purely for the purpose of improving coding practices.
Some Learnings from this Project
1. SwiftUI is fairly easy.
2. The App can be easily scalabe if you follow software engineering principles.
3. It is difficult to write unit tests for delegate functions, learnt about it in "iOS Unit Testing by Example" book by Jon Reid.
